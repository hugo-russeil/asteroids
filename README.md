# Asteroids
A simple implementation of the classic arcade game Asteroids using C and raylib. This project was created as a way to keep busy and learn while having fun.

## Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugo-russeil/asteroids.git
```

Once cloned, navigate into the repository directory and use the provided Makefile to compile the game:

```bash
cd asteroids
make
```

Ensure you have raylib installed on your system. If not, you can check out [raylib's website](https://www.raylib.com/).

## Usage
The keys to control the game are as follows:
- the arrow keys to move your spaceship
- the space bar to shoot
- the grave key (\`) to toggle debug mode.

## Features

This version of Asteroids is inspired by the original game but includes some differences as I did not aim to create a perfect replica.

## Contributing

While contributions are not expected, feel free to submit pull requests if you have any improvements or suggestions. My aim is to learn and i am open to any constructive feedback.
